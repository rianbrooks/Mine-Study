# Mine-Study
Given data from the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), we were asked to create two different models predicting injury rates per 2000 employee hours and identify the factors that are most important in minimizing these injury rates. These significant factors included the distribution of hours worked, the type of commodity mined, the type of mine, and the average number of employees working at each location.
